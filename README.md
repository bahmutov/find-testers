[![Package info](https://nodei.co/npm/find-testers.png?downloads=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/find-testers.png?downloads=true)

## Installation and run

Requires [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/), grab this repository, then

    npm install // installs dependencies
    npm test // runs unit tests
    npm run-script complexity // shows complexity metrics

## Background

A major feature of uTest is our tester-matching algorithm.  We are able to drilldown from a community of over 80k testers with multiple devices, to 10-20 testers that best meets a customer needs. As you can image, this is a complicated algorithm that takes multiple dimensions into account.

Your goal will be to write a simpler matching algorithm that takes two matching criteria (country and device) and presents a sorted list of results. The sort order is based on what the system is suggesting a user should select (more details below).

## Data Set Provided

* testers.csv: CSV list of testers. Each row corresponds to a tester.
* devices.csv: CSV list of all available devices. Each row corresponds to a mobile device. This is all the possible devices a tester can have.
* tester_device.csv: CSV list of tester to device. These are the devices a tester has. Each row corresponds to a tester and a device.
* bugs.csv: CSV list of all the bugs filed by a tester. Each row corresponds to a bug filed by a tester and contains a tester and the device the bug was reported on.

## Assignment

Write an application that will match testers based on a user search criteria. The search results should be ranked in order of experience. Experience is measured by the amount of bugs a tester filed for a given device. You can use any third party libraries, but be prepared to discuss why you decided to use it.

## Search Criteria

* Country: values should be collected from "tester.csv" and should also have an option for "ALL". User can select one or more countries. Multiple selections are treated as "OR".
* Device: values should be collected from "devices.csv" and should also have an option for "ALL". User can select one or more devices. Multiple selections are treated as "OR".


### Walk Through Example 1

```
Search Criteria: Country="ALL" and Device="iPhone 4"
Matches: 2 testers (User1 and User2).
User1 filed 4 bugs for iPhone 4.
    - 4 bugs filed for devices in search
User2 filed 10 bugs for iPhone 4.
    - 10 bugs filed for devices in search
Results: User2, User1
```

### Walk Through Example 2

```
Search Criteria: Country="ALL" and Device="iPhone 4" or "iPhone 5"
Matches: 2 testers (User1 and User2).
    User1 filed 4 bugs for iPhone 4 and 20 bugs for iPhone 5.
        - 24 bugs filed for devices in search
User2 filed 10 bugs for iPhone 4.
    - 10 bugs filed for devices in search
Results: User1, User2
```

### Walk Through Example 3

```
Search Criteria: Country="ALL" and Device="iPhone 6"
Matches: 2 testers (User3 and User4).
    User3 filed 4 bugs for iPhone 6
        - 4 bugs filed for devices in search
User4 filed 0 bugs
    - 0 bugs filed for devices in search
Results: User3, User4
```

## UI Output

How you output the results are up to you, there are no design requirements.

## Submission

Compress entire source code tree, include third-party jars and instructions how to run or access the running example.

## Presentation

Brad will get in contact with you on scheduling time for you to present and walk through your solution. During the presentation, there will be a couple engineers that will ask various questions about the code.
